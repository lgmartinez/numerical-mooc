In the [previous notebook](./05_03_Iterate.This.ipynb), we examined how different algebraic formulations can speed up the iterative solution of the Laplace equation, compared to the simplest (but slowest) Jacobi method.  The Gauss-Seidel and successive-over relaxation methods both provide faster algebraic convergence than Jacobi. But there is still room for improvement.  \n",
